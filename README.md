# BirdCustomCells

Custom cells are a great way to test your skills on building table views and using your protocols and delegates!

In this project we make cells that have an image, a label, and a button.
Pressing the button removes the cell from the table.

Yes, we could use built in methods to delete a cell from a table, but here we're customizing it and making our own delete button!
